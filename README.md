# Customer Segmentation- Marketing Campaign
Introduction
Customer Personality Analysis is a comprehensive examination of a company’s ideal customers. This analysis aids businesses in gaining a deeper understanding of their customers, allowing for the modification of products to meet the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different customer types.

Instead of indiscriminately marketing a new product to every customer in a company’s database, customer personality analysis enables a business to identify which customer segment is most likely to purchase the product. This targeted marketing approach ensures resources are utilized efficiently by focusing on the most promising customer segments.
